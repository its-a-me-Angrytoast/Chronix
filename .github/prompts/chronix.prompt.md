*** CHRONIX — IMPLEMENTATION FOR COPILOT ***
TODO: Make each point(marked by '-') into a todo task
-----------------------------------------------
*** Purpose ***: Generate a production-ready Discord bot named Chronix. Build it as a modular, scalable, async Python application using discord.py v2.x. Implement all features discussed and the full roadmap: gameplay (global), utility & moderation (server-specific), owner/dev controls, panels, logging (including non-audit events), music (Wavelink), chess, AI hooks (Gemini), RSS/YouTube feeds, and advanced announcement/ticket panels. Use prefix chro for CLI-style commands and also register equivalent slash commands. Use PostgreSQL (or SQLite for dev) for persistence. Provide tests, CI, Docker compose, and clear, sectioned code with comments.
*** Tone & goals for generated code: ***
-----------------------------------------------
- Production quality: typed, well-commented, modular.
- Async-first: avoid blocking operations.
- Secure: DB transactions for all money/loot ops, audit logs for critical actions, owner confirmations for destructive ops.
- UX-first: embed-based responses, panels, buttons, dropdowns, and live embed updates.
- Developer-friendly: clear folder structure, hot-reloadable cogs, debug utilities.
- Owner/dev separation: owner-only features limited to OWNER_ID in .env and only enabled on DEV_GUILD_ID or via FORCE_OWNER_OVERRIDE with explicit logging.
*** I — Project layout (generate these files & folders).If required create additional files (this is not the final layout) ***

*** III — Database schema (generate migration scripts) ***
-----------------------------------------------------------
- Create SQL migrations to add these tables. Provide proper indices and foreign keys. Use PostgreSQL syntax; include SQLite compatibility notes.
- Tables to create (primary fields only — include timestamps everywhere):
 - users (id BIGINT PK, chrons BIGINT, global_xp BIGINT, global_level INT, created_at)
 - guild_users (guild_id BIGINT, user_id BIGINT, xp BIGINT, level INT, balance BIGINT, last_message TIMESTAMP)
 - transactions (id SERIAL PK, user_id BIGINT, guild_id BIGINT NULL, change BIGINT, balance_after BIGINT, reason TEXT, created_at)
 - pets (id PK, owner_id, pet_type, name, rarity, level, xp, stamina, affinity, active BOOL, prestige INT)
 - weapons (id, owner_id, name, type, rarity, attack, crit_rate, slots, gems JSONB)
 - gems (id, owner_id, gem_type, rarity, power, created_at)
 - crates (id, owner_id, crate_type, created_at)
 - autohunt_sessions (user_id PK, enabled BOOL, last_run TIMESTAMP, essence BIGINT, level INT, cost BIGINT)
 - battles (id, battle_type, data JSONB, status, winner_id NULL, created_at)

 - user_items (id, owner_id, item_type, item_data JSONB)
 - cooldowns (id, user_id, command, expires_at)
 - leaderboards (views, caching table as needed)
Include migrations to rename mythcoins → chrons if migrating.
*** IV — Coding & behavioral rules for the LLM to follow ***
-----------------------------------------------------------
- Async everywhere — use asyncpg or databases for DB calls and avoid blocking IO.
- DB transactions for any monetary or loot change: always lock rows (FOR UPDATE) or use transactions to avoid race conditions.
- Secure RNG — use random.SystemRandom() for game RNG.
- Single scheduler loop — don't create per-user loops; create a single periodic scheduler that queries eligible autohunt sessions in batches.
- Live embeds — for autohunt, battles, and music panels, use message edit patterns (store message IDs in DB).
- Command parity — every gameplay command should have a slash command and a prefix alias (prefix is chro).
- Permissions — use custom checks (is_owner, is_dev, has_guild_admin, is_dj) stored in utils/perms.py.
- Owner/dev features — any absolute or dangerous command must require: (a) the command issuer matches OWNER_ID, (b) if run outside DEV_GUILD_ID, require dashboard confirmation & log to owner DM.
- Panels & UI — use Discord components (buttons, select menus, modals) to implement setup wizards. Panel flows must support preview and confirm steps.
- Logging — central utils/logger.py writes to file and inserts into logs table. Non-audit events (message edits/deletes, role changes, VC joins/leaves) are logged if LOG_NON_AUDIT_EVENTS=true.
- Testing hooks — each cog should include a setup function compatible with bot.load_extension.
*** V — Initial core modules to generate (priority order) ***
-----------------------------------------------------------
- Generate code for these cogs first, fully implemented and tested:
 - cogs/core/core.py — Bot startup, cog loader, config reader, graceful shutdown, basic health endpoints.
 - cogs/economy/economy.py — Chrons, /balance, /pay, /daily, transaction logging; DB transactions and tests.
 - cogs/gameplay/hunt.py and cogs/gameplay/autohunt.py — manual hunts, loot tables, autohunt scheduler with essence, live embed updates.
 - cogs/gameplay/gems.py and cogs/gameplay/crates.py — gem items, crate open flow, forge/empower endpoints.
 - cogs/gameplay/pets.py — pets CRUD, train/feed/prestige.
 - cogs/gameplay/battles.py — PvP and PvE turn-based battles (buttons), reward distribution, DB persistence.
 - cogs/gameplay/weapons.py — weapons equip/unequip/enhance.
 - cogs/gameplay/clans.py — clan creation, join/leave, treasury, BP system.
 - cogs/moderation/moderation.py — warnings, timed mutes, massban/masskick filters; audit logging/case system.
 - cogs/tickets/tickets.py — panel-based ticket setup, creation, claim, close, transcript.
 - cogs/announcements/announce.py — wizard, preview, schedule, templates.
 - cogs/logs/logger_cog.py — central listener for non-audit events; per-guild log channels creation with emoji prefix.
 - cogs/music/music.py — wavelink integration, queue commands, DJ role enforcement.
 - cogs/gameplay/chess.py — local chess play with python-chess and optional chess.com hooks.
 - cogs/feeds/rss.py & cogs/feeds/youtube.py — feed polling and embed posting.
 - cogs/ai/gemini_client.py — abstraction for AI features; opt-in per guild.
- Each cog must:
 - Register slash commands (app_commands) and prefix equivalents with aliases (e.g., hunt aliases h).
 - Use typed function signatures and detailed docstrings.
 - Include permission checks and proper error handling.
 - Use embed templates consistent across cogs (utils/helpers.py contains embed builders).
 - Include unit tests for core logic (loot generation, battle resolution, empower flow).
*** VI — Command naming & alias mapping (prefix chro) ***
-----------------------------------------------------------
- Implement prefix chro and alias sets. For every slash command below, create prefix equivalents and common aliases:
- Examples (full list generation required by LLM):
 - hunt — aliases: h, search
 - autohunt enable/disable — aliases: ah on/off, autoh
 - balance — aliases: bal, wallet
 - pay — aliases: give, transfer
 - pets — aliases: p, mypets
 - pet train — aliases: train, pt
 - battle — aliases: fight, duel
 - clan create — aliases: clan new, clan make
 - crate open — aliases: openbox, opencrate
 - gem empower — aliases: empower, socket
 - announce setup — aliases: announce, ann
 - ticket setup — aliases: ticket, tickets
 - music play — aliases: play, p
 - chess start — aliases: chess play, cstart
- Exact alias list: LLM should create aliases for all gameplay commands and reasonable shortcuts for admin/utility commands.
*** VII — Autohunt specifics & live embed behavior ***
-----------------------------------------------------------
- Single scheduler task obtains autohunt_sessions where enabled = true and last_run + interval <= now.
- batch process up to N users per tick to avoid rate-limits.
- Compute per-session cost from session level and apply atomic DB debit:
 - Begin transaction
 - SELECT chrons FROM users WHERE id = $1 FOR UPDATE
 - If insufficient, disable session and optionally DM user
 - Deduct cost, compute loot via random.SystemRandom, insert user items, award XP
 - Update autohunt_sessions.last_run and essence
 - Commit transaction
- Keep a live_message_id per session (or per user) to update status; if missing, post new message and store id in DB.
- The live embed displays:
 - status: enabled/disabled
 - last loot (icons)
 - total essence
 - coins spent/earned this cycle
 - active pets and stamina
 - upgrade suggestions (spend essence to upgrade)
*** VIII — Battle engine specifics ***
-----------------------------------------------------------
- Represent combatants by a normalized JSON structure:
{
  "user_id": 123,
  "team": [pet1, pet2],
  "weapon": { id, attack, crit },
  "hp": 100,
  "stats": {...},
  "affinity": 1.0
}
- Turn resolution algorithm:

 - Use deterministic base damage + RNG-based crit
 - Consider weapon attack, pet power, gem boosts, affinity multiplier
 - Example formula: damage = floor((weapon.attack + pet.power) * (1 + gem_bonus) * affinity * (1 + rand(0,0.2)))
 - Use ephemeral buttons for actions: Attack, Defend, Use Item, Switch Pet, Surrender.
 - Ensure timeouts: if a player doesn’t act in 60s, auto-skip or surrender after X warnings.
 - Persist battle state to battles table on each turn.
 - On win: award Chrons, XP, chance for gem drop; update battle logs.
*** IX — Gems, weapons, crates, and crafting ***
-----------------------------------------------------
- Gems have gem_type and rarity. Generate gem drop tables per crate rarity.
- Weapons have gem slots; each gem applied increases specific stats.
- Crates: crate_type determines pool. Opening a crate consumes crate item and yields items.
- Forge endpoint: /forge gem to combine multiple gems into a higher-rarity gem (with success chance), consume resources.
- UI: confirm modals before forging or empowering items; show before/after stats.
*** X — Clan & Team details ***
-----------------------------------------------------
- Clan creation costs Chrons; owner gets initial BP to spend on perks.
- Clan perks: XP boost, hunt rate bonus, clan shop discounts.
- Weekly clan wars: scheduled events run with aggregated battle outcomes.
- Clan treasury: members with manage_clan role can deposit/withdraw with logs.
- Teams: lightweight ephemeral groupings for group hunts/battles.
 - /team create/join/leave/invite commands.
 - Team hunts/battles share loot and XP among members.
*** XI — Tickets & Announcements (panel-based) ***
-----------------------------------------------------
- Ticket Setup wizard:
 - Steps: Select category → Set staff roles → Choose ping roles → Customize initial message → Confirm.
 - Store panel config to tickets table.
 - Ticket creation posts a message with button. When clicked, bot creates a private channel with overwrites and an embed with action buttons: Claim, Close, Transcript, Lock.
 - On close: compile transcript, post to logs channel, DM transcript to opener, mark ticket closed.
- Announcements wizard:
 - Steps: Choose channels → Template → Title/Description → Thumbnail/Image → Buttons/Links → Ping roles → Schedule → Preview → Confirm.
 - Store announcements in announcements table; scheduler posts scheduled announcements.
 - Support recurring announcements: daily/weekly/custom cron expression.
*** XII — Logging & non-audit events ***
-----------------------------------------------------
- Implement listeners for:
 - on_message_edit — log before/after
 - on_message_delete — content + author
 - on_guild_role_update — before/after role attributes
 - on_guild_channel_update — before/after channel attributes
 - on_voice_state_update — join/leave/move
 - on_invite_create — invite code + channel
 - on_invite_delete — invite code + channel
 - on_member_update — nickname changes, roles changes (record both)
 - Store logs in logs table and post to respective channel with emoji prefix naming convention: "🔒 | mod-logs", "🧭 | invite-logs", "🎮 | gameplay-logs".
- Log channel creation command:
 - chro create-logs for owner: creates full suite of log channels with emoji prefixes.
 - If run by server admin (non-owner), create only non-gameplay logs.
*** XIII — Music & DJ logic ***
--------------------------------------------
- Wavelink node(s) connection with auth from .env.
- Commands: play/search/queue/skip/pause/resume/volume.
- Optional DJ role enforcement: if MUSIC_DJ_ROLE_REQUIRED=true, enforce dj role for music control.
- Live queue embed with buttons for skip/vote skip/pause/resume.
- Persistent queue per guild saved in DB (so restarting bot restores queue).
*** XIV — Chess integration ***
-------------------------------------
- Use python-chess for local play with board rendering (unicode or image via Pillow).
- Slash/prefix commands: chro chess start @user, chro chess move e2e4.
- For chess.com integration: scaffolding for OAuth and polling public game feed; accept that full remote play requires chess.com API allowances — provide placeholders and config keys.
*** XV — Feeds & AI ***
-------------------------------------
- RSS:
 - Poll feeds per guild at interval. On new item, post embed with title/summary/image. Track last_item to avoid duplicates.
- YouTube:
 - Use YouTube Data API v3 to check new uploads; post embed to configured channel.
- AI (Gemini):
 - Provide an abstraction ai_client.generate(prompt, options) that is opt-in per guild. Use for:
 - Event generator
 - Ticket summarization
 - Moderation suggestion (human-in-the-loop)
 - NPC/gameplay flavor responses
 - Keep message privacy options in UI.
*** XVI — Tests, CI, and Docker ***
--------------------------------------
- Unit tests for:
 - Loot generator distribution (statistical checks)
 - Battle engine deterministic outcomes
 - DB transaction atomicity for place_bet, empower_item
 - Autohunt loop candidate selection and process_autohunt function
 - Integration/perf tests for autohunt under load (simulate many sessions).
 - GitHub Actions config to run tests, lint, and build Docker image.
 - docker-compose.yml for local dev: service db (Postgres), lavalink (Lavalink node), chronix (bot).
 - Health checks and logs via files and container logs.
*** XVII — Security & audit ***
-------------------------------
- Owner-only actions must:
 - Validate ctx.author.id == OWNER_ID
 - If FORCE_OWNER_OVERRIDE=false and the command affects remote guilds, require confirmation via dashboard button (owner must click).
 - Log action to owner DM webhook with server invite if unban owner is performed.
 - Use DB transactions for monetary ops and SELECT FOR UPDATE where needed.
 - Rate-limit expensive ops (massban, masskick).
 - Input sanitization for templates and embed fields.
*** XVIII — Developer outputs to produce ***
--------------------------------------------
- When generating code, create:
 - Fully implemented cogs with typed function signatures and PEP8 compliance.
 - README.md with setup steps (env, migrations, Lavalink).
 - docker-compose.yml and Dockerfile.
 - Alembic migrations or SQL files to create all tables listed.
 - Unit tests in tests/ for core systems.
 - Example data files: loot tables, crate pools, pet stat definitions (YAML/JSON in assets/tables).
 - Example .env.example.
*** XIX — Acceptance checklist (automated tests + manual checks) ***
-------------------------------------------------------------
- For each generated feature, include tests or manual verification steps:
 - chro hunt returns embed with XP, coins, loot.
 - chro autohunt enable starts recurring cycle and updates live embed.
 - chro balance displays Chrons (💠).
 - chro crate open shows animated reveal and awards items.
 - chro gem empower applies gem and updates stats.
 - chro battle @user runs a full match, awarding rewards and logging battle.
 - chro clan create registers a clan, treasury works.
 - chro ticket wizard creates channel, claim and close work, transcript is delivered.
 - chro announce setup builds a scheduled announcement and posts at scheduled time.
 - chro music play queues track and music plays via Lavalink.
 - chro log channels record message edits/deletes and role changes.
- Owner-only commands are present only on DEV_GUILD_ID and require confirmations if run elsewhere.
*** XX — Deliver final artifacts ***
-------------------------------------------
- Produce:
 - Full repository code (files above) ready to run after .env and DB migration.
 - SQL migration files.
 - Docker compose + instructions to run Lavalink + Postgres.
 - Unit tests and integration test scripts.
 - README.md with step-by-step run/deploy/test.
 - Sample assets (embed templates, loot tables, crate definitions).
 - Comments in code for maintainability & DX.
*** Final instructions to Copilot ***
---------------------------------
- Implement features exactly as specified. Where external APIs require keys or restrictions (e.g., Chess.com play, Gemini), provide scaffolding and clear comments describing required credentials and limitations.
- Use secure, production-ready patterns for DB and async code. Prefer asyncpg or databases with transactions.
- Provide comprehensive inline comments, type hints, and docstrings.
- Generate unit tests for key logic (loot, battle, transactions).
- Generate Docker and CI configs.
- Output one file at a time if necessary; otherwise create the full repo tree at once.
- Do not ask for confirmation keep continuing with the process. There is no phased development sequence
- When a choice is ambiguous (e.g., exact XP formula), implement a configurable default and document how to change it.
- Respect privacy: default AI features are opt-in and do not store conversation history unless explicitly enabled.
- skip tests and related work and do them at last
- use emojis in appropriate places in gameplay features
- Do not go in circles if something is not clear make a reasonable assumption and continue
