Phase 33 - Suggestions & Improvements
-------------------------------------
a final curated list of improvements, hardening items, and developer/operational tasks to take Chronix from "feature-complete" to "production-ready". Prioritized items that reduced risk, improved developer experience, and increased reliability.

Code quality & tooling
-----------------------
[ ] Add and enforce formatting and linting: Black, isort, flake8/ruff.
[ ] Add type checking with mypy and enforce via CI for committed code.
[ ] Add pre-commit hooks (black, isort, ruff/mypy, safety) and document contribution flow.
[ ] Run static analysis and security linters (Bandit, ruff security rules).

Testing & CI
------------
[ ] Add GitHub Actions workflows: fast-test (PR), full-test (nightly), integration (with Postgres+Lavalink), and publish pipeline.
[ ] Create a Docker Compose test environment for integration tests (Postgres, Lavalink) and reuse it in CI.
[ ] Increase test coverage threshold; add tests for critical transactional flows (economy, autohunt, battles).
[ ] Add end-to-end integration tests that run against real Postgres and Lavalink in CI.
[ ] Add smoke tests for startup, cog load, and command sync.

Database & Migrations
---------------------
[ ] Adopt Alembic (or formal migration tool) for versioned DB migrations; add CI migration checks.
[ ] Add migration test job in CI that applies migrations to a fresh DB and runs schema validation.
[ ] Add regular DB backups and a restore playbook (automate in Ops docs).
[ ] Audit and add missing indices for common queries (leaderboards, lookups, joins).

Security & Secrets
------------------
[ ] Move secrets into a secrets manager for production (Vault/AWS Secrets Manager/GCP Secret Manager) and document the flow.
[ ] Add dependency scanning (safety, Snyk) to CI and block known-vulnerable packages.
[ ] Add automated secrets detection in commits (prevent accidental leaks).
[ ] Harden bot permissions: document minimal OAuth scopes and required guild permissions.

Reliability & Observability
----------------------------
[ ] Integrate structured logging and a centralized sink (files -> log rotation or external logging: Datadog/ELK).
[ ] Add metrics exporting (Prometheus) and dashboards for key signals (queue lengths, autohunt rate, command errors, memory/cpu).
[ ] Add Sentry (or equivalent) for error reporting with contextual breadcrumbs and user IDs obfuscated.
[ ] Define SLOs and alerting rules (e.g., health endpoint fail/latency, background task errors).

Performance & Scaling
---------------------
[ ] Add optional Redis cache for hotspot data (leaderboards, guild configs) and document cache invalidation strategy.
[ ] Load-test core flows (autohunt scheduler, battle resolution) and identify contention points.
[ ] Optimize DB transactions (SELECT FOR UPDATE use) and add connection pooling guidance for asyncpg.
[ ] Add rate-limiting for expensive owner-only ops and mass actions to avoid API spikes.

Deployment & Ops
-----------------
[ ] Improve Docker image by pinning base images and adding non-root user, healthchecks, and multi-stage builds.
[ ] Add a `docker-compose.prod.yml` with recommended volumes, networks, and environment file structure.
[ ] Provide Helm charts or Kubernetes manifests for production deployments (readiness/liveness, autoscaling).
[ ] Add runbooks for common ops: restart bot, restore DB, rotate token, revoke compromised tokens.

Backups & Data Retention
------------------------
[ ] Define and implement backup retention policies for Postgres and file-backed data.
[ ] Add data export commands (JSONL) and a scheduled archival job.
[ ] Add pruning for logs and old DB rows (retention/archival scripts).

UX, Accessibility & I18n
------------------------
[ ] Audit embed colors and contrast for accessibility; document fallback themes for dark/light modes.
[ ] Expand i18n coverage; add translation pipelines and tests for missing keys.
[ ] Add keyboard-friendly and mobile-friendly embed interactions (button fallbacks and timeouts).

Developer Experience
--------------------
[ ] Add CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, and PR/Issue templates.
[ ] Add a developer quick-start (README dev section) that boots the compose stack and runs tests.

Acceptance criteria for Phase 33:

[ ] CI workflows added (fast-tests + integration) and passing on main branch.
[ ] Production deployment playbook exists and is validated by a dry-run deployment.
[ ] Monitoring/alerting and backups are in place for production.
